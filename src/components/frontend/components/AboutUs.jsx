              Residence is one of the basic needs of human beings. United Nation
              (Article 25 of the United Nations’ Universal Declaration on Human
              Rights) and constitution of Bangladesh (Article 15-a of Bangladesh
              constitution) recognize the shelter as one of the basic needs. The
              demand of housing in urban areas in developing countries like
              Bangladesh is dramatically increasing due to population increase
              and its fast growth rate. Rural people are migrating not only to
              find jobs but many wealthy people are moving to urban areas like
              Dhaka city for the fulfillment of their expectations of better of
              their future generation, and for enjoying the modern facilities of
              the city life. With the progression of economic growth of the
              country, standard of living has improved quite significantly.
              Apartment buildings are replacing houses and bungalows as Dhaka
              becomes more congested and land prices increase. The city is also
              moving towards the development of suburbs and suburban areas away
              from the urban core, which can ease the burden on roads and
              properties. Most customers prefer to have their own house, rather
              than spending a significant amount of their monthly income on
              rent. Moreover, number of city corporations have increased and
              realtors are eyeing on these new areas too. This has resulted into
              a serious crisis all over the country especially in the major
              cities of Bangladesh.

              Bangladesh's economic growth has shown commendable performance in
              growth of above 5% for the last 20 years. We believe that
              Bangladesh has strong macroeconomic fundamentals and huge
              potentials of becoming an economic power house and the 30th
              largest economy in the world by 2030 .In Bangladesh, real estate
              emerged as a crucial sector of our economy. It has a huge
              multiplier effect on economic activities. It is one of the largest
              employment-generating sectors after agriculture and garments. It
              also stimulates demand for allied industries, for example steel,
              cement, tiles and sanitary ware, cable and electric wire, paint,
              glass and aluminum, brick, building materials, and consumer
              durables. It is assumed that currently every year more than
              120,000 household units are required to house the added population
              in Dhaka. In this situation, the supply of housing in the city is
              only around 25,000 units in private sector.
